This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving modifying a vector while holding a reference to one of its elements. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  The error occurs because pushing a new element to the vector can invalidate existing references if the vector needs to reallocate its internal memory. The solution involves using techniques that prevent the mutation from affecting existing references.
